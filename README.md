# EYE_CONTROLLED_MOUSE
To use the Eye Controlled Mouse program, you need to position your face in front of the camera such that the right eye is clearly visible. As you move your right eye, the program will track the eye movements and move the mouse pointer accordingly. To perform a click operation, simply close your left eye, and the program will detect the change in the vertical distance between your left eyelids and perform a click event.
